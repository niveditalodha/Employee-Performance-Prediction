# Employee-Performance-Prediction

The main goal is to use machine learning algorithms to forecast an employee’s promotion. In order to get the best results, different algorithms are used with varying prediction capabilities. There are a number of factors that endure the likelihood for employees promotion. The goal is to identify the attributes that have the greatest influence on an employee’s performance and promotion, as well as to forecast whether or not the employee will be promoted. The classification techniques used are Decision Tree using Information Gain, Random Forest,Support Vector Machine, K-Nearest Neighbour, and Naive Bayes to achieve the best results.
